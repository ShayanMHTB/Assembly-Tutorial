# Assembly Language -- Tutorial  

Here I practice a programming in Assembly language. These are a collection of your typical beginner level programms and scripts people write in JAVA, Python and other programming languages when they start learning, with the twist, that they are written in assembly langauges.

## Description:  

After installing the necessary software and writing your application, simply make sure `xcode-select`, `as` and `ld` are installed:  

```bash
# Ask for xcode-selct version
xcode-select -v

# Ask for assembly langauge version
as -v

# Ask for linker version
ld -v
```  

Then you can simply write your assemly program, compile it, then link it to your commanLineToll to be able to run it in Terminal.  

```bash
# ~/hello-world.asm

# Compiling the application
as hello-world.asm -o hello-world.o

# Linking the application
ld hello-world.o hello-world -lSystem /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib

# Run the application
./hello-world
```
